			<h2>Electrons</h2>
			<p>In conductors, the outer electrons of each atom are bound so loosely that many of them break free and jump around from atom to atom. These free electrons are like sheep grazing on a hillside: They drift around aimlessly but donâ€™t move very far or in any particular direction. But if you give these free electrons a bit of a push in one direction, they will quickly get organized and move together in the direction of the push.</p>
			
			<h2>Electricity and Voltage</h2>
			<p>Electric current (often called electricity) is the displacement of a large number of 
				electrons in the same direction through a conductor when an external force (or 
				push) is applied. That external force is known as voltage</p>
